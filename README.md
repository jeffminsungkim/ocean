## Brief Introduction

To me, learning a new knowledge in programming is like standing against unidentified creatures living in the  **deep ocean**.
I am pretty much excited about spending my time for learning awesome stuff that I do not even know before, but it also gives me a slight headache from time to time. :man_technologist:
