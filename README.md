## Brief Introduction

To me, learning a new knowledge in programming is like standing against unidentified creatures living in the  **deep ocean**.
I am pretty much excited about spending my time for learning awesome stuff that I do not even know before, but it also gives me a slight headache from time to time. :satisfied:

**This repository consists of problem-solving exercises and new languages practices.** If there's any mistake or have a better solution for code, feel free to share your thoughts and may open the [issues](https://github.com/jeffminsungkim/ocean/issues).
