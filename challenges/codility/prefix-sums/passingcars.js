Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:

0 represents a car traveling east,
1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.

We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).

A[0] = 0
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 0
A[3] = 1

Explanation: 
A[1] A[0] (1 pass)

A[3] A[0]
A[3] A[2] (2 passes)

A[4] A[0]
A[4] A[2] (2 passes)

Total: 5 passes.
